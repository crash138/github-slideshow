""What the pandemic has taught me is to drop things, realize how little I need. I don't need to shop, I don't need to go anywhere, or travel. I think I have too much. I look around and tell myself why all this. What do I need more than two dishes for. Afterwards, realizing who the real friends and people I want to be with." ~Adriana Josefina Fresta"
